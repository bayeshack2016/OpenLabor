Amplifying Employee Empowerment

## Income inequality is a key policy target for the Department of Labor and the White House. The Gini index, a standard measure of inequality, has risen to a level not seen since the 1920's, and it shows no stopping. Although America has added 14 million jobs in the last 8 years and unemployment has fallen from 10% to 5%, average wages remain stagnant.

Our project aims to give American employees tools and information needed to make change and improve their lives. Emplify follows a 3-E approach:
1. **Engage**: Provide details on current working conditions
2. **Educate**: Inform and compare current employee working conditions against Dept. of Laboro benchmarks
3. **Enact**: Proactive dialogue and collective action for improvement in employee conditions

## Engage
We tell the individual the story of how transparency and collective can help improve their conditions.

## Educate
We give employees key information about where they stand in the job market. We provide local and national benchmarks, and compare their current salary to these numbers. We also inform individuals of new opportunities to pursue relative to their skills, and what financial benefit they might expect to get from these opportunities.

## Enact
We seek to empower individuals to take collective action by connecting with others in similar situations. We group the individual with others working similar jobs in the same area, and provide two platforms for action:

#### Enact initiatives
1. A Facebook group specific to that group in that time. If no Facebook groups already exists, we provide them the opportunity to found a new group.
2. Links to relevant change.org petitions. These empower the individual to establish a collective voice and spread awareness about employee issues.

# Outcome
Our goal is to empower individuals with a safe environment and community to take proactive action on their employment conditions.
